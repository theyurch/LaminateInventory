This rails app is intended to be used as a replacement for Carefree Industries' existing laminate database, which is currently just an access database with a custom interface.

Users need to be able to search for availability and modify laminates. Laminate history (moves, changes, additions) has a rudimentary tracking that needs to be extended further, mainly per-user.
